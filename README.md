# Inverse-Kinematics
This repo contains the code to move a 3 dof 3D printed robot arm though inverse kinematics. The goal is to simplify the movement of the arm for a person to easily manually control the claw and later implement it into a limbed robot of some sort.
## Hardware and Software Used
- Arduino Pro Micro
- 4 9g Servos
- Arduino IDE
- Minicom
- [Arm STL file](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1015238)
